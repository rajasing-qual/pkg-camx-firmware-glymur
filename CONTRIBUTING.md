# Contributing to Packaging repository for pkg-camx-firmware-glymur

Hi there!
We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project.
Your help is essential for keeping this project great and for making it better.

## Branching Strategy

Development happens on distro-specific branches. The active branches are:
- `qcom/ubuntu/resolute` — Ubuntu 26.04 (Resolute Raccoon)
- `qcom/debian/trixie` — Debian Trixie

Open a PR targeting the specific distro branch you are modifying.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Please read our [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) and [license](LICENSE.txt).
1. [Fork](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/pkg-camx-firmware-glymur/fork) and clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/pkg-camx-firmware-glymur.git
    ```

1. Create a new branch based on distro:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <my-branch-name> qcom/ubuntu/resolute
    ```

1. Create an upstream `remote` to make it easier to keep your branches up-to-date:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/pkg-camx-firmware-glymur.git
    ```

1. Make your changes, verify the package builds successfully with
   [docker-pkg-build](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/docker-pkg-build)
   and make sure it works fine.
1. Commit your changes using the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/). You can
   attest to the DCO by committing with the **-s** or **--signoff** options or manually
   adding the "Signed-off-by":

    ```bash
    git commit -s -m "Really useful commit message"
    ```

1. After committing your changes on the distro specific branch, sync it with the
   upstream branch:

    ```bash
    git pull --rebase upstream qcom/ubuntu/resolute
    ```

1. Push to your fork.

    ```bash
    git push -u origin <my-branch-name>
    ```

    The `-u` is shorthand for `--set-upstream`. This will set up the tracking reference
    so subsequent runs of `git push` or `git pull` can omit the remote and branch.

1. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/pkg-camx-firmware-glymur/pulls) from your
   branch to the appropriate distro-specific branch (e.g. `qcom/ubuntu/resolute` or
   `qcom/debian/trixie`).
1. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed.

## Security Analysis of Pull Requests

To maintain the security and integrity of this project, all pull requests from external
contributors are automatically scanned using [Semgrep](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep)
to detect insecure coding patterns and potential security flaws.

**Static Analysis with Semgrep:** We use Semgrep to perform lightweight, fast static
analysis on every PR. This helps identify risky code patterns and logic flaws early in
the development process.

**Contributor Responsibility:** If any issues are flagged, contributors are expected to
resolve them before the PR can be merged.

**Continuous Improvement:** Our Semgrep ruleset evolves over time to reflect best
practices and emerging security concerns.

By submitting a PR, you agree to participate in this process and help us keep the
project secure for everyone.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Here are a few things that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being
accepted:

- Follow the [Debian Policy Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) for
  packaging conventions and use [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) to validate
  any shell scripts.
- Update `debian/changelog` with a clear entry describing your change.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If you want to make multiple independent
  changes, please consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
  and sign off with `git commit -s`.
- It's a good idea to arrange a discussion with other developers to ensure there is
  consensus on large features, architecture changes, and other core packaging changes.
  PR reviews will go much faster when there are no surprises.
